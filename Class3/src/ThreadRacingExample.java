/**
 * ThreadRacingExample - Demonstrates the concept of thread racing
 * 
 * This program simulates a race between multiple runners (threads) on a track.
 * Each runner advances at random speeds, and the first to reach the finish line wins.
 * This illustrates how threads can execute at unpredictable rates, leading to
 * non-deterministic outcomes in multi-threaded applications.
