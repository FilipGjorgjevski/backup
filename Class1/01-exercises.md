# Class 1: Working with files and folders

## Exercise 1:
Create a program in JAVA with which you
will create a file with unique name  (e.g., uniqueFile_TIMESTAMP.txt, where TIMESTAMP is the current timestamp)
and output
the following for that file:
- The name
-  The location
-  Both absolute and relative
-  The reading and writing privileges
-  The name of the folder in which the file resides.
-  Before you create it, test if it already exists.

## Exercise 2:
Create a Java program that counts the number of lines in a file named content.txt and prints the count to the console.

## Exercise 3:
Implement a Java program that searches a given directory for files with a specific extension (e.g., .txt) and prints the paths of these files.

## Exercise 4:
Write a Java program to check if a given directory is empty or not. The program should print a message indicating whether the directory is empty.

## Exercise 5:
Create a Java program that writes an array of bytes to a file named binaryData.bin, and then reads the content of the file back into a byte array and prints it.

## Exercise 6:
Write a Java program to append text to the end of an existing file named appendText.txt. If the file does not exist, create it.

## Exercise 7:
Develop a Java program that lists and prints the names of files in a specific directory that were modified in the last N days.
