# Setting Up a Basic Spring Boot Project Using Spring Initializer

## Introduction
Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform, which paves the way for a faster and more efficient development ecosystem.

## Getting Started with Spring Initializer
Spring Initializer is an online tool that provides a convenient way to generate Spring Boot projects. With just a few clicks, you can set up your project base and start coding.

### Step 1: Generate Your Project
- Go to [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/)
- Choose your preferred project metadata (Group, Artifact, Name, Description).
- Select your Spring Boot version. Usually, the default selected version is the recommended one.
- Add dependencies according to your project requirement. For a basic project, consider adding 'Spring Web'.

### Step 2: Download and Open Your Project
- Click on the "Generate" button.
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file and open it with your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

## Exploring Spring Core Concepts in Spring Boot

### Dependency Injection
Spring Boot leverages Spring's dependency injection mechanism to simplify the management of application components and services.

#### Example
Create a simple service and inject it into a controller.

**MyService.java**
```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {
    public String getHelloMessage() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
