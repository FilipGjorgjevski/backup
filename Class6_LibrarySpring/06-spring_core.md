# Spring Core Concepts Guide and Exercises

## Introduction to Spring Core
Spring Core, the foundation of the Spring Framework, provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. At its heart lies the principle of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI), which helps in decoupling the construction of objects from their usage.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Inversion of Control (IoC)
IoC is a principle where the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. In Spring, IoC is achieved through the ApplicationContext, which manages the lifecycle and configuration of application objects.

### 2. Dependency Injection (DI)
DI is a design pattern used by IoC to achieve loose coupling. Dependencies (services or objects that a class needs to perform its function) are injected into classes rather than the classes creating or finding the dependencies themselves.

### 3. Bean Management
In Spring, objects that form the backbone of your application and are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container.
